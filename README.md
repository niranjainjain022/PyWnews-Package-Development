# PyWnews-Package-Development
Made a python package that gives the top latest world news from a website. It was basically a web scraper made using urllib.request, HTML Table Parser, BeautifulSoup and other basic python libraries like pandas and numpy. The goal of the scrapper was to get list of the top most important news from the website and return a list. I have also published an article for the same demonstrating how I did it.
